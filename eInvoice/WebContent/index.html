<!-- Name:Ranjeet Bassi
DueDate: October 12, 2012

The reason why I submited the assignment late was because I was actively trying hard to fix a problem in the 
invoiceBinder.jsp. For some reason it was able to port over the library files. Secondly passing the data from invoicefrom to invocingdeptservlet 
took me quite some time to figure out what the problem was. -->

<td>This web application allows users to create/view/edit invoices. The Outstanding invoices allows users to see a list of the 
of the invoices. This would give flexibility for the users to see the invoices one by one. Saving the updated invoices will not be possible
as this feature is still under development.</td>
